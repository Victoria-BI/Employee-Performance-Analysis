# Employee-Performance-Analysis
**Background**


In order to restructure, the company is interested in recruiting a fresh set of employees. The human resource (HR) manager wants to find out what patterns exist among the employees before commencing the hiring process. This report provides a detailed analysis of the salary, sick leave totals by department and job title, and gender distribution within the organization.


**Data extraction and cleaning**



The Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process was used for this analysis. The data needed was extracted from the company database using SQL and downloaded into an Excel file. The data was cleaned in excel by removing duplicates and formating the data before transforming it in power query and loaded into Power BI for visualization.
