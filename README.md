**Background**


In order to restructure, the company is interested in recruiting a fresh set of employees. The human resource (HR) manager wants to find out what patterns exist among the employees before commencing the hiring process. This report provides a detailed analysis of the salary, sick leave totals by department and job title, and gender distribution within the organization.


**Data extraction and cleaning**



The Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process was used for this analysis. The data needed was extracted from the company database using SQL and downloaded into an Excel file. The data was cleaned in excel by removing duplicates and formating the data before transforming it in power query and loaded into Power BI for visualization.

The male gender accounts for 206  while the female gender accounts for 84. with the male gender accounting for 71.03% of the total number of employee, there is a need for the HR to recruit more female in the forth coming recruitment process.

**Recommendation**


The HR manager needs to have a meeting with the production technicians to better understand their work schedule and to know why the take the most sick leave. Due to tthe nature of their work, they may be exposed to some harmful chemicals in the production hall which may lead to constant sickness. This should be addressed as soon as possible to reduce health risk.

The HR also need to priotize employing more females in the forth coming recruitment process.
